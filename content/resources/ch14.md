description: Lecture notes about transport of passive and active tracers in turbulent
  flows, tracer transport in Eulerian coordinates, eddy fluxes and the multi-scale
  method, Zeroth order solution, first order solution, second order solution, eddy
  diffusivity, antisymmetric component of the eddy diffusivity, symmetric component
  of the eddy diffusivity, eddy diffusivity and moments of tracer concentration, the
  transformed Eulerian mean, and diffusive flux in tracer coordinates.
